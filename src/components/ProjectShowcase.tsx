/**
 * Straightforward project showcase: every project renders as a card in a
 * responsive 2-up grid — no dial/selector, no single-focus state to page
 * through. Only the first `INITIAL_COUNT` show by default (six full
 * project write-ups made the section feel very long); a "Show more"
 * toggle reveals the rest.
 *
 * Whenever the *visible* count is odd, the last visible card would be
 * left alone in its row with an empty gap next to it — so that one card
 * (and only that one) renders as a wider "featured" split (see
 * ProjectCard) spanning both columns instead. With `INITIAL_COUNT = 3`
 * this means the 3rd card starts featured; once "Show more" reveals all
 * 6 (an even count), nobody needs to be featured and it animates back to
 * a plain stacked card via ProjectCard's `layout` animation rather than
 * snapping between the two shapes.
 *
 * Clicking a card (or its "Explore project" button) opens that project's
 * full case study in a modal, tracked by `expandedSlug`.
 *
 * While collapsed, a bottom-fade scrim over the last visible row plus a
 * small pulsing "+N" badge on the button (both gated by `isTruncated`)
 * signal that the grid is deliberately cut off rather than complete —
 * without either, a quick skim of the page could read 3 cards as "that's
 * everything" and miss the toggle entirely.
